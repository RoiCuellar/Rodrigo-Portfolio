            1. Manifesto: <br>
            Creating this cadavre exquis was a funny experience. It started by analyzing and understanding this new concept. Then I blended personal interests into a cohesive vision. I replaced irrelevant elements of the original idea with ones that resonate with me, like airplanes and trains for travel, a roller coaster and Ferris wheel for fun, a casino for entertainment, towering for architecture style, and a beautiful night with a moon and fireworks. This idea reflects my life since 2021, a period marked by frequent travel - especially back to my home in Mexico- where I have enjoyed immense fun and the opportunity to immerse myself in activities I love. However, it also captures the opposite feeling of leaving behind those utopian moments of happiness and relaxation to return to the reality of everyday life. From this assignment and the result, I learned it is important to enjoy those joyful moments while accepting life's inevitable transition and movement. This cadaver exquis is a reminder to face the future with optimism and hope, knowing that every ending brings the opportunity for a new beginning. <br>
            <br>
            2. Critical Evaluation: <br>
            - Casino and mechanical games (e.g., ferris wheels and roller coasters) symbolize excitement and fun, capturing the moments of adrenaline I love and that, in my opinion, mirror the thrill of travel and exploration. <br>
            - The beauty of a night illuminated by city lights, and a big moon evokes a sense of magic and relaxation. <br>
            - Mexican Flag and some Mexican decorations over the buildings and traditional fireworks represent my country. A place where I have so many good memories. <br>
            - Big skyscrapers are icons of urban modernity and capitalism, a symbol that my town in Mexico is currently using to represent both the joy and the excitement of adventure. <br>
            - Finally, Airplanes and Trains stand as icons of hope and excitement but also as the way back of those incredible adventures to our daily life where we need to change our interests and goals like living two lives at every moment and place, in my case one in Mexico and one back in Canada. <br>

        From Assignment 02, I learned the importance and complexities of working with different 3D modeling formats between various software, such as Blender, Rhino, and Creality Slicer Print. To achieve this task, I used various formats such as OBJ, FBX, PLY, GLB, STL, and Gcode. Experimenting with these different options helped me realize there is more than just one exporting solution and that each has unique qualities that can either enhance or limit the model capacity and future development. Knowing which format works best for each specific case will be extremely valuable in future projects at the university. It will allow me to identify and use the best tools depending on the projectâ€™s requirements, improving my design skills to be more effective.<br>
        I also experimented and gained insight into new geometry modeling concepts and methods such as Mesh, SubD, and NURBS. To be honest, Mesh was already familiar to me, but NURBS was a particularly interesting concept. I discovered Meshes are more useful for objects with more detailed textures, while NURBS is a good technique to be more precise and in my opinion offers a broader space to experiment and refine things to add more detail or just to fix any error. For us as students, it is essential to compare and learn the distinctions between these geometry types and the applications based on the goals and current development stage.<br>  
        In conclusion, this assignment modified my design perspective by exposing a variety of options while crafting and strengthening my skills. It makes evident there is more than just one option and that it is important to make the right choice for the right moment/phase. Nowadays technology is a major aspect of design and architecture (the field I am particularly interested in) so I need to stay informed about the range of available tools on the different software sites, to be a more prepared and productive designer.
